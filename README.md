<h3> Task 2: </h3>
Transitioning into Gazebo simulation, I embarked on the challenge of spawning an ebot within a dynamic racetrack environment. I cloned the requisite repository into my workspace and flawlessly launched the ebot in an empty Gazebo world. I also installed teleop_twist_keyboard to facilitate the controlled navigation of the ebot. Even though I couldn't do everything perfectly, I did my best to solve problems and learn as much as I could.
